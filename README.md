# Resistor_App
Resistor calculator computes resistor band colors and determines what resistance the colors represent. 
May implement a method in the future of retreiving colors from a resistance value given by a user input.

Main source code located at: Resistor_App / app / src / main / java / k22jung / resistor_app / MainActivity.java 

Designed for tablets, specifically Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Ed).
